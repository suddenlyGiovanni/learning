[Bianca Gandolfo]

## Description

Bored by the academic approach of most data structures and algorithms courses? This is for you!

You'll learn to solve algorithms and analyze **space and time complexity** in both an interview setting and in your day-to-day development.

Following along with the course, you'll practice algorithms with common interview questions using a handful of algorithm techniques. Take a practical look at **recursion** and learn to optimize your solutions using **divide-and-conquer**. Implement **merge sort** and **quicksort** and understand tradeoffs of both approaches. Plus, get started with **dynamic programming** and memoization!
