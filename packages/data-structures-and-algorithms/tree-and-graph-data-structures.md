Frontend Masters - [Tree and Graph Data Structures]

Published: May 20, 2019

## Instructor

[Bianca Gandolfo]

## Description

Learn the implementation details of **tree** and **graph** data structures, interview questions involving them, and the algorithms to solve them.

This course builds on Biancaâ€™s Practical Algorithms and Data Structures for Interviews courses.

Unlike arrays, trees and graphs are non-linear. This allows for modeling things such as recommendation algorithms and social networks.
