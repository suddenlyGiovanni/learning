# _suddenlyGiovanni_'s learning monorepo

## Description

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, This is my personal **learning** ðŸ—„ monorepo.
It contains multiple sub repositories regarding different subjects that, at one point, I have decided to explore.

Immediately below, you can find the list of all the available sub repo and a link to their respective Readme.

**PS:** I'm still in the process of porting over all my GitHub public learning repositories under this same umbrella.
